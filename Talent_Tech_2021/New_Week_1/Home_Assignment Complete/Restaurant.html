        Red Robin is going to have to be one of my favorite burger joints to go
        eat at with a good menu to choose from.

    <!-- Manhattan Pizza -->

      <h1>Manhattan Pizza</h1>
      <img src="./Restuarants Imgs/Manhattan PIzza.jpg" alt="Manhattan Pizza" />
      <p>
        Address: <br />
        9660 Falls of Neuse Rd #133, Raleigh, NC 27615
      </p>
      <p>
        I found this local pizza joint about four months on Falls Of Neuse and
        so glad I found it. The pizza out there is outstanding and you don't
        want to try their pizza, then they have some other good food choices to
        choose from. <br />
        If you don't believe me, then

        5200 Capital Blvd, Raleigh, NC 27616
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one of my many Steakhouses that I like to visit with some
        friends. If I don't feel like cooking my own steak, then I'm always
        taking a trip to outback to get a steak or their blooming onion!
        <br />They have a good menu to choose from as well,

      </p>
      <p>
        This amazing sushi house is not too far from manhattan pizza that I
        mention earlier. Saki House have a huge menu of different sushi and
        cannot express you how much I love their Shrimp Tempura rolls! <br />
        if you love sushi, then you should check out their

        Address: <br />
        6325 Falls of Neuse Rd #19, Raleigh, NC 27615/p>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I cannot forget about Taza Grill. One of my favorite places when it
        comes down to mediterranean food!<br />
        The place doesn't have a big
